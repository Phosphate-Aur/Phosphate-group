<p>#Biorecycling of phosphate by yeasts#
##Context##
*Phosphorus* is present in combined form as phosphate. Phosphorus is a key resource because it is an essential component of living cells and has industrial and agricultural uses. 

They are also used as food additives or in meat and poultry products to improve yield, texture and moisture retention, and as thickening agents in dairy products. Moreover, phosphorus is used in Light electric vehicles for batteries.

Above all, one of the major use is the production of nutrients in the agricultural field. The major issue is that it is a declining resource and that our consumption is exceeding the natural regeneration rates.

Phosphorus has two origins : phosphate rocks and organisms. The transformation of phosphate rock into usable phosphates involves the use of sulfuric acid, which in turn depends on resources obtained from mining and the petroleum and gas industries. Furthermore, the process often relies on the combustion of fossil fuels, contributing to environmental issues, especially for transformation into fertilizers.
As we saw in an article, 70% of the reserve is located in Morocco, which can create geopolitical, economical and social issues in the future.
So phosphate , with various origins, is then found in water, causing eutrophication of the aquatic environment.
When nitrate and phosphate ions concentrations in shallow water bodies are in excess, there is overgrowth of water plants leading to the formation of algal bloom. This causes a high consumption of dissolved oxygen in the water. Dissolved oxygen in the waterbody reduces drastically leading to the suffocation and death of aquatic plants and animals. The dead plants and animals decay creating deterioration of water quality + release of towins that are lethal for aquatic organisms and humans This process is named eutrophication.

**Link with agricultural transition:**
One of the reasons for eutrophication is the run-off of nutrients such as phosphates and nitrates into lakes and rivers.
These nutrients come from an overuse of fertilizers and detergent that contain these elements. 
Moreover, the effluent from aquaculture and other concentrated animal feed operations have been noted to contribute to the occurrence of nitrate and phosphate in wastewater discharged into the environment.
The aim of this project is  to find a sustainable alternative to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture to limit water pollution and ecosystem disruption. 
Our research could also lead to the development of a circular system in which phosphate is reused to turn it into polyphosphate and then be able to use it elsewhere. For instance, in the industry, or to feed plants, or fire prevention.
